<h4> The rookie out of Kentucky had a solid first regular season, but really emerged as a young star in the Heat’s historic playoff run. Herro solidified himself as Miami’s tertiary scoring threat, averaging 16 points per game for the fifth-seeded Heat.</h4>
	<p>The Miami Heat have something special in Tyler Herro. And they knew long before we did. And once Tyler Herro landed in the NBA bubble, he’s been a different type of player.

In his seven games in Orlando, he’s averaging 17.4 points, 5.1 rebounds and 3.9 assists while shooting 53% from the field and 37.8% on threes. That’s a whole lot better than the rest of his rookie season.
